🌟 PrognosAI - Predictive Maintenance System

📋 Project Overview

PrognosAI is an AI-driven predictive maintenance system that estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery using multivariate time-series sensor data. Built with NASA CMAPSS datasets, this system enables timely maintenance decisions, minimizes unplanned downtime, and optimizes asset utilization through deep learning techniques.
